README -- winexe with waf build system
======================================

Build instructions
------------------
Winexe uses waf for building.  At the configure stage you can choose
either the default (viz., to build against public Samba 4 headers and
libraries) or the option of building against the Samba 4 source tree.

As of 20 March 2012 it is not yet possible to build against public
Samba 4 headers, so the second alternative must be chosen.

Install 32 and 64-bit cross-(to-Windows)-compilers.  E.g., on Ubuntu 11.10

    sudo aptitude install gcc-mingw-w64

After cloning the winexe tree, e.g.,

    git clone git://winexe.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/winexe/winexe-waf

also obtain the Samba 4 source tree.

    cd winexe-waf
    git submodule update --init samba

Configure and build.

    cd source
    ./waf configure --use-samba-tree-headers
    ./waf build

If you are a developer then edit stuff, commit and push.

    git commit -a
    git pull
    git push git+ssh://USERNAME@winexe.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/winexe/winexe-waf

Later you may want to update the Samba 4 source tree.

    cd samba
    git pull
