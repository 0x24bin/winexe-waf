README -- winexe with waf build system
======================================

Instructions
------------
After cloning the winexe tree, e.g.,

    git://winexe.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/winexe/winexe-waf

also obtain the samba tree.

    git submodule update --init samba

Then configure and build.

    cd source
    ./waf configure
    ./waf build

Later, update the samba sources.

    cd samba
    git pull

If you are a developer then edit stuff, commit and push.

    commit -a
    git push git+ssh://USERNAME@winexe.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/winexe/winexe-waf

Issues
------

1. popt.h

C header file popt.h is #included by lib/cmdline/popt_common.h which is
#included by winexe.c.  A file by that name gets built at
bin/default/include/public/samba/popt.h.  This file seems to be found
and used during a bare Samba build, but for some reason it is not found
during a winexe-waf build when Samba waf tries to compile "../source/winexe.c".

A workaround is to make popt.h available on the system include path, e.g.,
by installing the libpopt-dev package in Debian and Ubuntu.
